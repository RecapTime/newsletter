## Past

We thank to our past and inactive contributors for contributing
to the newsletter even once in their lifetimes. To added here,
you must contributed into the project atleast 1 issue triaged
by either an team member or one of our community members and
also either got their first merge request merged to
the upstream. Feel free to travel around past commits if the
list is kinda incomplete for you.

## Sponsors

We thank our sponsors for keeping the newsletter sustainable in
the future, either monetary or socially. Patreon and
Libreapay supporters get preview of what we're working next
first before the world ever knows, get shoutouts in each issue,
and more (merch discounts soon).
