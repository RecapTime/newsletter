# Sponsoring/Supporting The Pins Team

Thanks for your interest to sponsor us (either financially or
in other ways, like promoting us on socials)! While this is not
yet another legalese text you'll read

## General Guidelines

* Critcism is fine, but being hatred or even racist is not
  allowed across our community. Please follow our community
  guidelines and code of conduct as written in the
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file.
* We do not accept sponsorships from companies, even if it's
  iFixIt or Nvidia. We want to keep independent as much as
  possible.
* Don't spread lies. That's cursed under the international law.
  We don't lid either. (We may hide some secrets like some
  undocumentated internal stuff, but we may add it to the handboom
  so please pardon us.)

## Ways to Still Support Us, Even Without Money

Like any content creator, we value our community more than
the money, and we also make quality content over quantity.
So how do you support us?

- **Spread the word.** We pay nothing for the ads, just to make
  us popular (not yet as of writing of this / March 2021).
  But still, sharing our work to others through your socials
  help.
- **Help us make it better!** Nothing is perfect, but we can do
  it better than what is it in the past. Contributing to the
  open-source is one of the ways to help us make it better,
  and possibly make it great again.
- **Participate in the community.** Our community may small (as
  of writing of this), but with these above, you help us grow
  the community with love and care it deserved. Maybe have an
  small talk with us in Twitter/Mastodon within the all-you-can-talk
  buffet style, just eat these and have fun.
