### Epic Games cooking Apple using their own money

> Full article: https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22412899/epic-apple-trial-rules-investment-app-payment, https://www.polygon.com/22396021/itchio-epic-games-store-windows-pc-apps and https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games

Okay, you heard about the Epic v. Apple case in the past week weeks right? And you asked why Epic Games cook Apple. Well, possibly as an investment. But no, they also want to force Apple to change the rules and possibly fire up more antitrust investiagtions against Big Tech (we don't know, just saying).

And as we read the article, we found out that Itch is on Epic Game sotre. That's not sus for us, especially Epic don't take cuts on Itch, right?

And by the way, greed isn't illegal, even that's what moviates them [despite thier CEO's saying](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369622/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ban-basic-freedoms-developers), they want to make an "metaverse", an haven where characters owned by different companies can ever meet and see together.

Buy even if one of those companies wins, [the loser as always is you](https://youtu.be/uqj2z3QaRyU?t=165). Why? We're just NPCs who literally drop random loot bullstuff [to the Big Tech](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/technology/big-tech-pandemic-economy.html).

So you're working on an SaaS but want to have an free plan? That's probably what most SaaS companies hate, but some dare because it's thier marketing plan to reach new customers without paying them a dime.

Like us, [we do the research](https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/insights/b2b-buying-journey) and probably background checks, even we looked at the pricing, before we even sign up for an SaaS service. After we signed up and completed the onboarding, we test the product and decide if we'll gonna pay, stay in the free plan for an while or ditch-and-switch.

### 2FA by default on Google accounts

> Full article: https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422778/google-accounts-enabling-two-step-verification-default

Google is rolling out 2FA by default to accounts, slowly to avoid the account lockout issues, to small group of people and measuring login success rates and they want their feedback about it.

If you're ready to let Google turn 2FA on for you, just make sure you're signed in to your phone(s) and actively using it (if you're just use your account for email and Play Store, probably you may not auto-enrolled) and have recovery information added.

If you turned on 2FA on your Google account ahead of time, nice! Just make sure you keep your second-factor options up-to-date, probably get an security keys to better protect your account from phlishing and social engineering attacks.

> Full article: https://www.wired.com/story/frag-attack-wi-fi-vulnerabilities 

A set of vulnerabilities in how Wi-Fi works is its design expose virtually every single Wi-Fi-supported device, and some of these flaws are been around since its original standard debuted in 1997.

As usual, update your devices into latest patched to keep you protected. But even without software updates, you should make sure that websites you're going have HTTPS on it. Otherwise, you should use an VPN (only use it if you think your government acts like Chinese government).

### ...and some Google I/O stuff

Remember that last year's went cancelled due to the pandemic? They're back this year, but now it's free woth some swag and merch for those who brought an ticket last year. (Timezones are hell messier, but atleast they're on-demand after I/O 2021, most of these.)

From the [Android 12 redesign](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-12-redesign-1225716/), to [their partnership with Samsung to challenge Apple Watch](), and more, if you're late at the party, you can watch this quick recap from [Google](bshq).

We also recommend to read [TechCrunch's coverage](https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-i-o-2021) of Google I/O 2021 for more.

### Finally, some more stuff

* [Parler is back on Apple App Store](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/17/parler-apple-app-store/), but posts that labeled as `hate` are not available on the iOS app, among other things.
* So you think WhatsApp's new privacy policy BS for you? No problem, switch to Telegram if you want cloud backups (you still need to create e2e chats) and more, or if you want security, there's Signal. (What about Element, if you want an mofe decentralized platform?)
* An munted $#!tshow happened in Freenode as devs flee to other IRC networks after [an "takeover" by Korean Crown Prince](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ev8y/freenode-open-source-korea-crown-prince-takeover), in which case, we definitely f&#ked.
