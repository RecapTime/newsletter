Okay, the Audacity team wants to know

### Ben Awad finally abandoned DogeHouse...

...and if that's the case for DogeHouse users and its community, [we definitely Zucked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOmdkN6MOwU). And as usual, we'll be in Hawaii sending thoughts and prayers on abandoned projects like these.

Why? Because different companies are on the bandawgon on adding audio spaces into their apps, even Discord and Telegram. And even [Clubhouse is bringing Android users to theor platform](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/clubhouse-begins-externally-testing-its-android-app) (through you still need an invite first).

We can't see what Ben Awad build next in the future. And if you want to be first to get notified, [follow him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/benawad) and [subscribe to his YouTube channel](https://rtapp.tk/benawad-yt). (Editorial disclaimer: This promotion is not paid by Ben Awad himself.)

* **From JS Party:** Need to use Node.js in the browser without disabling security features on your Electron apps? No problem, [WebContainners by StackBiliz is here to help](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5U83QXrfKl7lUhEY87PyyL?si=oQ8NlnpTRsSAvraTpzCdng&utm_source=copy-link&dl_branch=1). (It's in beta as of time of writing, so proceed at your own risk and will be open-source once in GA.) It's still Node.js you know and love, but complied as WebAssembly and powered by Chromium's V8 engine (so you don't need to worry about all the chaos management in patching V8 side on the Node.js binary itself).
- But what about an full-blown Ubuntu (or Alpine) desktop in an container inside an browser (without installing any VNC client)? [Watch this video from Techno Tim](https://youtu.be/Gd9bvdkIXOQ) on how to setup an minimal Linux desktop in Docker with Compose.
