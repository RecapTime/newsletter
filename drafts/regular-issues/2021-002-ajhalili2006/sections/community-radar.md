Okay, the Audacity team wants to know

### Ben Awad finally abandoned DogeHouse...

...and if that's the case for DogeHouse users and its community, [we definitely Zucked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOmdkN6MOwU). And as usual, we'll be in Hawaii sending thoughts and prayers on abandoned projects like these.

Why? Because different companies are on the bandawgon on adding audio spaces into their apps, even Discord and Telegram. And even [Clubhouse is bringing Android users to theor platform](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/clubhouse-begins-externally-testing-its-android-app) (through you still need an invite first).

We can't see what Ben Awad build next in the future. And if you want to be first to get notified, [follow him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/benawad) and [subscribe to his YouTube channel](https://rtapp.tk/benawad-yt). (Editorial disclaimer: This promotion is not paid by Ben Awad himself.)
