## Updates from The Pins Team

We're busy doing some chores in our Matrix rooms to be ready for you to join, including setting up an Space for our Matrix rooms. They'll be bridged over our Discord servers and Telegram chats to keep the interoperability.

Our official Matrix rooms with their bridged channels are (bridges are not yet ready, so expect chaos in meanwhile):

* [#thepinsteam-pub-chat](https://matrix.to/#/#thepinsteam-pub-chat:matrix.org) - general discussions about our open-source work and the org (with off-topic stuff allowed as long as it's not politics or drama), bridged over [#chatroom on our main Discord server](https://discord.rtapp.tk/thepinsteam) and [@ThePinsTeamCommunity on Telegram](https://telegram.me/ThePinsTeamCommunity)
* [#recaptime](https://matrix.to/#/#recaptime:matrix.org) - Recap Time-related stuff, bridged over [#chatroom in Recap Time's Discord](https://discord.rtapp.tk/recaptime) (soon to he moved at our main Discord server) and [@RecapTime_LiveChat on Telegram](https://telegram.me/RecapTime_LiveChat).

The updated list of them in the future is on <https://rtapp.tk/official-matrix-links> (they'll automagically goes into our Space), just in case we go bigger. We use `matrix.to` links so we can fire into your favorite Matrix clients as possible while the `discord.rtapp.tk` links uses the same Kutt instance, just we used custom domains for these shortlinks (which we need to tell Railway to add that custom domain into our project's custom domains list).

Also, we got an Guilded server for both public facing channels and internal channels. While Guilded is more packed with features than in Discord, we may merge the Recap Time Discord server and our main server soon-ish to use auto-broadcasting stuff on announcements, forums and stuff.

But we have an problem on Guilded. The Bot API isn't public yet at time of publication, as we need to wait longer for Matrix-to-Guilded bridges to freely available. We consider doing userbot stuff, but as usual in Discord, that's an grey area.

We're also working on updating the team hamdbook contents to clean up unneeded stuff and add more content, especially about these changes above. (Don't forget, we're looking for developers and even HR people, because Andrei Jiroh can't handle all the roles. We'll turn The Pins Team into an company in the future, but for now, let's chill out.) Also don't forget that we're writing onboarding and offboarding stuff.

### What about any Recap Time-related stuff

And oh, check out [Gildedguy's Discord Server Out of Context Twitter account](https://twitter.com/GildedGuildOOC) for mostly out-of-context memes and then some from Gildedguy's Discord sverer (we want to keep spoilers down, but be warned).
