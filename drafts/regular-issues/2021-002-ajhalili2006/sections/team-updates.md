## Updates from The Pins Team

We're busy doing some chores in our Matrix rooms to be ready for you to join, including setting up an Space for our Matrix rooms. They'll be bridged over our Discord servers and Telegram chats to keep the interoperability.

Our official Matrix rooms with their bridged channels are:

* [#thepinsteam-pub-chat](https://matrix.to/#/#thepinsteam-pub-chat:matrix.org) - general discussions about our open-source work and the org (with off-topic stuff allowed as long as it's not politics or drama), bridged over [#chatroom on our main Discord server](https://discord.rtapp.tk/thepinsteam) and [@ThePinsTeamCommunity on Telegram](https://telegram.me/ThePinsTeamCommunity)
* [#recaptime](https://matrix.to/#/#recaptime:matrix.org) - Recap Time-related stuff, bridged over [#chatroom in Recap Time's Discord](https://discord.rtapp.tk/recaptime) and [@RecapTime_LiveChat on Telegram](https://telegram.me/RecapTime_LiveChat).

The updated list of them in the future is on <https://rtapp.tk/official-matrix-links>, just in case we go bigger. We use `matrix.to` links so we can fire into your favorite Matrix clients as possible while the `discord.rtapp.tk` links uses the same Kutt instance, just we used custom domains for these shortlinks (which we need to tell Railway to add that custom domain into our project's custom domains list).
