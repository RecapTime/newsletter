## Curated Picks

Here are some picks we had been choosen as we explore around the internet within the last quarter. Also, some of them contains saitire, so beware.

- First of all, grab some popcorn as you read [this saitirical Dev.to article](https://dev.to/blaketweeted/the-truth-about-open-source-developers-wds-2-2bb9) from [Blake Campbell](https://twitter.com/BlakeTweeted). (And no, he's not from The Juice Media.)
- Speaking of vaccine rollouts across the world, you [shouldn't worry if you seen reports of vaccinated people having COVID-19](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/29/1024301/vaccines-covid-breakthrough-infections-immunity-cdc). In fact, tracking them help researchers to uncover viral variants that manage to avoid any immune response.
- From Linus Tech Tips: Yes, Apple is more innovative, but wait, [Google hold the beer](https://youtu.be/qCnM4osEIII) in this year's virtual keynote in I/O.
- Remember that Google+ failed? Now, [Google is about to bring back RSS to Chrome](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/05/an-experiment-in-helping-users-and-web.html). Can you tell us [why Mozilla is so obsessed folowing Google's footsteps](https://twitter.com/nixcraft/status/1395313399815311362?s=20)? Probably because of [this nonsense](https://bshq.rtapp.tk/nonsense-bs-105jdywp).
- **[Google I/O 2021]** From 9To5Google: Annnnnnnd, they're switching to their own font, [Google Sans Text](https://9to5google.com/2021/05/19/google-sans-text/) in their apps.
- Does owning an Apple device turns me into Apple's digital slave? Well, Telegram founder Pavel Durov [says yes](https://www.androidauthority.com/telegram-apple-digital-slave-1227646/). And also, Apple users will [gonna f*#ked](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOmdkN6MOwU) after reading that. Switch to Android when? (You should switch to Android after knowing that BS.)
- **[Google I/O 2021]** Chrome OS' Linux app is [leaving beta in Chrome 91](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445382/chromeos-linux-release-beta-version-91), among other things announced in [What's New in Chrome OS](https://youtu.be/a8kkzdOfAgU) session. You know it, you can now use Linux apps in Chrome all while updates are magically happen as you upgrade your OS. (Please don't ask us if you can run snaps there, since we always assume there's no systemd in there, which is probably fine for you.)
- And here's some [first TechLonger episode on Star Citizen](https://youtu.be/bYs_zn2pTZo) and [the story behind an Chinese man of the world's largest phone empire](https://youtu.be/VIggp85vgZA).
- Did you remember to allow your lawyers to review your next posts about your company? [Elon Musk seems to forgot it](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463920/elon-musk-stock-price-tweets-sec).
- **[Windows 11/10X]** By the way, Microsoft is about to release Windows 11 (or Windows 10X if that's not 11, we don't know) by November this year. Before that, [let's take this mindfullness moment first](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-wants-you-to-calm-down-about-windows-11-in-a-twisted-wonderful-way/) for 11 minuges. And of course if you don't want to upgrade, you have [until November 2025](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/323676-microsoft-will-drop-support-for-windows-10-by-2025?utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook) to decide if you switch to Linux or get stuck in Apple's walled garden (pun intended, but it's your decision).
* **[Apple WWDC]** From ZDNet: Unlike the past years, [you can stay on iOS 14](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-14-could-become-apples-windows-xp/) instead of upgrading to iOS 15 and still get security upgrades and still use Apple services you paid for (and keep being locked out of their walled garden). Is this Windows XP, you asked? Well somewhat.
* For fans of NFTs: The WWW inventor will [sell the source code as an NFT](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/world-wide-web-inventor-to-sell-source-code-/5929893.html). (this might be sold out if you read this from the future)
