Last March 6, Michael Moy oversimplified his characters, and even Oxob, One and Skid. We're not doing some
One and Skid $#!tpost here.

Yes, these are all cursed as you'll may say. Is this all started because of

Let's dig around the chat archives we had, and eat these:

* Don't worry, there will be no oversimplified Lillian as of now.

* Is this yet another crappy CN reboot of [I FORGOT WHAT IT CALLED, LET ME KNOW IN THE COMMENTS]?
