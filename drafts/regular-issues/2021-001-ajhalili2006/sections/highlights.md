## Highlights

- Gildedguy Story #0 is expected to be released by March 31 (April 1
in PHST). Read on or visit [our megathread in the forums](https://rtapp.tk/megathread-ggstory0)
to learn more.
- Some of tech news we handpicked are now baked for your consumption.
One of them is the possibility of iMac Pros getting discontinued and
investigations against racism inside Facebook's hiring process.
- As The Pins Team keeps expanding the online footprint, we had successfully
arrived Mastodon (for bringing updates and stuff) and Launchpad (for mirrors
stuff) with Framagit soon.
- As we kick off our Medium publication this 2021, we had some memes
and possibly your-favorite-digital-creators-went-out-of-context,
especially the one who oversimplify One and Skid (Michael Moy did
that lol).
- WIP
