## Some Tech News

> We try to pick what we deem important to discuss in this issue. So,
if we missed some and want to see them in the future issues,
[send us an GitLab issue](https://gitlab.com/MadeByThePinsHub/RecapTime/newsletter-archive/issues/new)
as we'll look into it. As usual, keep coming back into your favorite
tech news site or [watch new TechLinked uploads](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeeFfhMcJa1kjtfZAGskOCA) every MWF for more stuff.

* Looks like Apple pull [more iMac models](https://www.engadget.com/apple-pulls-imac-models-m1-refresh-103829331.html) ahead of its possible M1 refresh. No more
512GB and 1TB SSD configurations for the 21.5 inch iMac. Maybe Apple is stopped producing products due to
the same global shortage in the tech industry.
* As [this non-SolarWinds-related attack](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/02/new-nation-state-cyberattacks/) is ongoing since January, over 30,000 organizations (governmental + commerical)'s emails got [hacked via  Microsoft Exchange Server flaws](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316189/microsoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations).
If your org uses Exchange Online, this doesn't apply to you. Otherwise, update as much as possible.
* Are loot boxes look like gambling bull$#!t? If so, [Germany may restrict games with loot boxes](https://www.engadget.com/germany-video-game-loot-boxes-adult-requirement-145154466.html) to
people above 18. This may raise some games' age rating into 18, or go to the usual geoblocking-slash-age gating.
* Looks like [Trump plans to launch an social network in 2-3 months](https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-social-network-211532975.html), but whether
or not he got some tech partners are what his another matter he need for now. (don't forget the US Capitol riot last
January 6)
* [USB-C is cursed](https://hackaday.com/2021/03/22/cursed-usb-c-when-plug-orientation-matters/),
and non-USB-C users want correct plug orientation. (seriously, this
is not an tech news, but pardon us)
* [Companies in US don't like unions?](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22320009/amazon-bessemer-union-rwdsu-alabama)Looks like an
David and Goliath battle in Bessemer, Alabama to watch at night, right? But nah, they don't know Bessemer too much.
* Also, [Microsoft wants to acuqire Discord, worth over $10M+](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345792/microsoft-discord-acquisition-report-10-billion).
If Discord will not go public instead, please expect some ads (we don't think so)
and maybe Mr. Clippy and friends will jump over your server. (don't forget
to say hi).
