After days of drafting the first issue and procanisting for weeks, we got into this. Welcome to the first issue of Recap Time!


<!-- ./highlights.md -->
## Highlights

- Gildedguy Story #0 is expected to be released by March 31 (April 1
in PHST). Read on or maybe [watch the announcement on YouTube]().
to learn more.
- Some of tech news we handpicked are now baked for your consumption.
One of them is the possibility of iMac Pros getting discontinued and
investigations against racism inside Facebook's hiring process.
- As The Pins Team keeps expanding the online footprint, we had successfully
arrived Mastodon (for bringing updates and stuff) and Launchpad (for mirrors
stuff) with Framagit soon.
- As we kick off our Medium publication this 2021, we had some memes
and possibly your-favorite-digital-creators-went-out-of-context,
especially the one who oversimplify One and Skid (Michael Moy did
that lol).
- ICYMI: Hyun's Dojo Community YT channel reached 2 Million subs, so [are you ready for THIS?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-lclBxiqBc) (Actuallym Michael Moy teased us again in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GildedguyArt/status/1372965987688050690), and surely the 2 million dance video went into coconuts.)
