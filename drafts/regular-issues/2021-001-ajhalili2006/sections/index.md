After days of drafting the first issue and procanisting for weeks,
we got into this. Welcome to the first issue of Recap Time! Expect
we may not keep the newsletter fresh every two weeks. Also please
be reminded that this was crafter from March 6 to 27, with additional
1-2 days for peer review and handling publishing stuff to Medium.

<!-- ./highlights.md -->
## Highlights

- Gildedguy Story #0 is expected to be released by March 31 (April 1
in PHST). Read on or maybe [watch the announcement on YouTube]().
to learn more.
- Some of tech news we handpicked are now baked for your consumption.
One of them is the possibility of iMac Pros getting discontinued and
investigations against racism inside Facebook's hiring process.
- As The Pins Team keeps expanding the online footprint, we had successfully
arrived Mastodon (for bringing updates and stuff) and Launchpad (for mirrors
stuff) with Framagit soon.
- As we kick off our Medium publication this 2021, we had some memes
and possibly your-favorite-digital-creators-went-out-of-context,
especially the one who oversimplify One and Skid (Michael Moy did
that lol).
- ICYMI: Hyun's Dojo Community YT channel reached 2 Million subs,
so [are you ready for THIS?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-lclBxiqBc)
(Actually Michael Moy teased us about this in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GildedguyArt/status/1372965987688050690),
and surely the 2 million dance video went into coconuts.)

## Some Tech News

> We try to pick what we deem important to discuss in this issue. So,
if we missed some and want to see them in the future issues,
[send us an GitLab issue](https://gitlab.com/MadeByThePinsHub/RecapTime/newsletter-archive/issues/new)
as we'll look into it. As usual, keep coming back into your favorite
tech news site or [watch new TechLinked uploads](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeeFfhMcJa1kjtfZAGskOCA) every MWF for more stuff.

* Looks like Apple pull [more iMac models](https://www.engadget.com/apple-pulls-imac-models-m1-refresh-103829331.html) ahead of its possible M1 refresh. No more
512GB and 1TB SSD configurations for the 21.5 inch iMac. Maybe Apple is stopped producing products due to
the same global shortage in the tech industry.
* As [this non-SolarWinds-related attack](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/02/new-nation-state-cyberattacks/) is ongoing since January, over 30,000 organizations (governmental + commerical)'s emails got [hacked via  Microsoft Exchange Server flaws](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316189/microsoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations).
If your org uses Exchange Online, this doesn't apply to you. Otherwise, update as much as possible.
* Are loot boxes look like gambling bull$#!t? If so, [Germany may restrict games with loot boxes](https://www.engadget.com/germany-video-game-loot-boxes-adult-requirement-145154466.html) to
people above 18. This may raise some games' age rating into 18, or
go to the usual geoblocking-slash-age gating.
* Looks like [Trump plans to launch an social network in 2-3 months](https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-social-network-211532975.html), but whether
or not he got some tech partners are what his another matter he need for now. (don't forget the US Capitol riot last
January 6)
* [USB-C is cursed](https://hackaday.com/2021/03/22/cursed-usb-c-when-plug-orientation-matters/),
and non-USB-C users want correct plug orientation.
* [Companies in US don't like unions?](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22320009/amazon-bessemer-union-rwdsu-alabama)Looks like an
David and Goliath battle in Bessemer, Alabama to watch at night, right? But nah, they don't know Bessemer too much.
* Also, [Microsoft wants to acuqire Discord, worth over $10M+](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345792/microsoft-discord-acquisition-report-10-billion).
If Discord will not go public instead, please expect some ads (we don't think so)
and maybe Mr. Clippy and friends will jump over your server. (don't forget
to say hi).
