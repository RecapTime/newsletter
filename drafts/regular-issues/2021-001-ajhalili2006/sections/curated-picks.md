* New to Dream SMP (or just curious about the fandom)? An [The Verge article](https://www.theverge.com/22338418/dream-smp-youtube-minecraft-fanart-fanfiction-video-edits-fandom) cover the essientials ans the feels of an fan can help.
* What if "trust fall" can be simulated (or even programmed) [to an robot](https://psyche.co/ideas/what-falling-robots-reveal-about-the-absurdity-of-human-trust)? If that happens, the robots can also stop its fall but the aspects needed to develop an physical trust and releationship between humans and robots are still missing. (Please don't ask Elon Musk if robots replace humans in the future.)
