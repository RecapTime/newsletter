## Curated Picks

Picks from us and the community from your favorite creators that's currently inside and outside of our watchlist (pardon us,
but ping us on Twitter and on Mastodon if you want that article toget featured), plus more stuff. As the newsletter matures, we move open-source stuff, among others, in their own sections soon.

* New to Dream SMP (or just curious about the fandom)? An [The Verge article](https://www.theverge.com/22338418/dream-smp-youtube-minecraft-fanart-fanfiction-video-edits-fandom)
cover the essientials and the feels of an fan can help.
* What if "trust fall" can be simulated (or even programmed) [to an robot](https://psyche.co/ideas/what-falling-robots-reveal-about-the-absurdity-of-human-trust)?
If that happens, the robots can also stop its fall but the aspects needed to
develop an physical trust and releationship between humans and
robots are still missing. (Please don't ask Elon Musk somewhere in YouTube
if robots replace humans in the future.)
* If you don't careful, [your multi-billion NFTs can go to the graveyard](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
And while IPFS can help, you might need to wait months as you know,
decentralized platforms need to seed and cache content across multiple
nodes, and in case of IPFS across planets (if humans ever lived in
the moon or even on Mars).
* Alan Pope, Martin Wimpress and Mark Johnson are now connected to
your mind for community news and events for everything Ubuntu,
Mark are migrating away from an command line utility to Bitwarden

They also rediscovered Keybase and a lot of blogging in
[March 18, 2021 episode](https://ubuntupodcast.org/2021/03/18/s14e02-toast-letter-club/).
(This is not Alan Pope's official Blog Post Podcast, yet.)
* [Why there's the disconnect between Y Combinator Demo Days and due diligence?](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/y-combinator-demo-day-dispo-due-diligence) Well, it's chaotic for us to answer.
If you want to invest with us on Patreon, [go ahead and pick the tier, we recommend tiers with $50+](https://www.patreon.com/ThePinsTeam) (we're not sure if $50 is fine for corporate patrons, but let us know in the comments)
Otherwise, please wait as we write the document for investment stuff. With your due diligence required. ([listen to related TechCrunch Equity podcast episode](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/you-can-only-invest-if-you-promise-not-to-read-the-fine-print-ok/))
* [Wait, GameStop selling GPUs?](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353287/gamestop-amd-nvidia-gpu-graphics-cards-on-sale-pc-hardware) Linus said yes because people need yet another retailer fighting over graphic cards' stock.
