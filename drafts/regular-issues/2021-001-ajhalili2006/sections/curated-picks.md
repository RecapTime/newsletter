* New to Dream SMP (or just curious about the fandom)? An [The Verge article](https://www.theverge.com/22338418/dream-smp-youtube-minecraft-fanart-fanfiction-video-edits-fandom)
cover the essientials and the feels of an fan can help.
* What if "trust fall" can be simulated (or even programmed) [to an robot](https://psyche.co/ideas/what-falling-robots-reveal-about-the-absurdity-of-human-trust)?
If that happens, the robots can also stop its fall but the aspects needed to
develop an physical trust and releationship between humans and
robots are still missing. (Please don't ask Elon Musk somewhere in YouTube
if robots replace humans in the future.)
* If you don't careful, [your multi-billion NFTs can go to the graveyard](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
And while IPFS can help, you might need to wait months as you know,
decentralized platforms need to seed and cache content across multiple
nodes, and in case of IPFS across planets (if humans ever lived in
the moon or even on Mars).
* Alan Pope, Martin Wimpress and TK are now connected to your mind for
community news and events for everything Ubuntu, they are
migrating away from Lastpass (probably, please correct this if
I'm wrong) to Bitwarden as mostly Lastpass free users did in the
past weeks since the announcement regarding the changes to the free tier,
and more in [the Ubuntu Podcast March 25, 2021 episode](https://ubuntupodcast.org/2021/03/25/s14e03-tiny-spider-transmitted/).
They also rediscovered Keybase and a lot of blogging in
[March 18, 2021 episode](https://ubuntupodcast.org/2021/03/18/s14e02-toast-letter-club/).
