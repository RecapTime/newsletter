## Some Gildedguy Story #0 Updates

...and some stream memes for grins and giggles, but our
editor-in-chief prefers to place it in the Memes section of
this issue.

Okay, March 31 will be the worldwide premiere date on both Twitch
and YouTube. The hype is gonna keep up until we broke our measurements
in the unforeseenable future. (Depending on your timezone and the time
of premiere, some of you may went to the wrong side of the road, AKA
April 1. Please no more "Watch premieres at 3 AM" again, YouTubd.)

4 more future stories confirmed, but the fans at Discord are still
under heavy debate if Story 10 will be an
Gildedguy vs. [SPOILER KENSORED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7uuttPwLRg&lc=UgyPkusnD-hegITXOXh4AaABAg.8etJwhb-q4X8f7h5uTXLiX).
(Michael's comment on the [Erase Humanity Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7uuttPwLRg&lc=UgyPkusnD-hegITXOXh4AaABAg)
may hint about the possiblity of Story X.)
