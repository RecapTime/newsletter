First of all, we're now arrived the fediverse. Follow us on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.online/@thepinsteam)
([don't forget to follow Recap Time also](https://mastodon.online/@RecapTime))

Second, Heroku maybe an sus to us. Zeet got yeeted by abusers.
Divio and Railway was chosen to maybe place our future APIs and
some interactive stuff that needs an backend server or just
doing cloud development with Coder or running yet another Wiki.js
instance. We might move some of our projects away from Heroku
soon, so please don't ask us why.

> Sidenote: Railway is currently on early stages, so we might stuck
> with 3 projects per user (among other things to ensure everything is fine),
> we gonna try Divio for most of our projects.
