# Newsletter Archive

This is where we draft our future issues here, and to allow our
community to write for us as possible. We try to focus more on
qualuty over quanitity, so each merge request/future post undergoes
both editorial and community review. 

## Hierachy

Please be reminded that this is NOT an exhaustive documentation on
either our editorial processes or how to contribute into our newsletters.
They're just summarized by Andrei Jiroh for future team members and
contributors in case he either passed away or on vacation.

### Main Directories

* `/drafts` - Where future issues goes by, and where contributors
incolubate their proposals to be published in our Medium publication.
Contributions are open!
* `/publish-todo` - Finished issues that passed BOTH
initial passed editorial review AND any additional checks required as
per the contributing guide will be moved here so one of our
Medium publication editors (mostly team members).
* `/done` - The ones that are successfully published to Medium. Only
bugfixes are only accepted. CODEOWNERS is strictly enforced by
default in this directory.
* `/rejected` - Stuff that rejected (AKA against Medium ToS,
violates our Community Code of Conduct or at reviewer's discretion)
goes here. Note that if you want to fix issues raised BEFORE moving
your issue/article there, please fix ASAP, otherwise you need to
start over again.

### By Category

In each directory, there are three subdirectories that keep stuff
organized. This may change as more categories are introudced,
renamed or removed in the future.
