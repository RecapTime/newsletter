# Newsletter Archive for Recap Time

This is where we draft our future issues here, and to allow our
community to write for us as possible, without the need for an Medium
account to be added as an author in our publication. We try to focus
more on qualuty over quanitity, so each merge request/future post
undergoes both editorial and community review. 

## Hierachy

Please be reminded that this is NOT an exhaustive documentation on
either our editorial processes or how to contribute into our newsletters.
They're just summarized by Andrei Jiroh for future team members and
contributors in case he either passed away or on vacation. Please see
the documentation at `/docs` directory.

### Main Directories / By Status

* `/drafts` - Where future issues goes by, and where contributors
incolubate their proposals to be published in our Medium publication.
Contributions are open!
* `/publish-todo` - Finished issues that passed BOTH
initial passed editorial review AND any additional checks required as
per the contributing guide will be moved here so one of our
Medium publication editors (mostly team members).
* `/done` - The ones that are successfully published to Medium. Only
bugfixes are only accepted. CODEOWNERS is strictly enforced by
default in this directory.
* `/rejected` - Stuff that rejected (AKA against Medium ToS,
violates our Community Code of Conduct or at reviewer's discretion)
goes here. Note that if you want to fix issues raised BEFORE moving
your issue/article there, please fix ASAP, otherwise you need to
start over again.
* `/templates` - Templates to get you started. Please be reminded to
store your media stuff by yourself at
<https://git.rip/MadeByThePinsHub/assets-bucket/recaptime-newsletter-archive>

### By Category

In each directory, there are three subdirectories that keep stuff
organized. This may change as more categories are introudced,
renamed or removed in the future.

* `<status>/regular-issues` - The usual Recap Time issue. Mostly
written by Andrei Jiroh with some community input.
* `<status>/community-contributions` - Community posts by the
community. Newsletter maintainers, CNH board and The Pins Team Staff
can also write content for that category.
* `<status>/community-updates-radio` - Open-Source Release Radar,
Fediverse Radar, and then some.
