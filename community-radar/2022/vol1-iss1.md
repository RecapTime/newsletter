> **CONTENT WARNING**: There are some links and mentions about what's happening in the current global pandemic, among other things, so if in doubt, please dive deeper and do your own research. What the mainstream media is saying might lie to you, so please proceed with caution. The legalese parts will usually follow US laws for simplicity, please consult an legal expert for help on your local laws.

## Tech and open-source

We handpick some technology and open-source news and related content first, including legalese stuff surrounding the tech industry and even some content from the community.

* Microsoft avoided the latest antitrust round, but then brought an company for $69 billion. [This might not go smoothly for antitrust enforcers](https://www.vox.com/recode/22893117/microsoft-activision-antitrust-big-tech),
but assuming that the company learnt its leassons on past antitrust roasts, we think this largest acquisition on its history might be fine.
* It's tax season, atleast in the US, but [the Great Resignation has been arrived to public accountants](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22903016/public-accountants-big-quit-memes-reddit). If everybody isn't here,
[is this busy season an learning opporunity for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/rhs132/this_busy_season_will_be_better/) or you chose to leave the chat AKA press the rage quitting button, anyone?
* If you didn't know, there's [an hidden egg on Golang's Git commit history on an commit over 20+ years ago](https://repography.com/blog/go-first-commit). By the way, [there's more other than your regular Subversion stuff](https://research.swtch.com/govcs) on their switching-between-VCS process. We don't know then if they gonna switch again if something will gonna replace Git in the distant future.
* ICYMI: [Akamai accquired Linode in February 15](https://www.linode.com/press-release/akamai-to-acquire-linode/), but having the word `metaverse` on the press release make us doubt even more on what's Meta Platforms is doing.
* Legalese ahead: If you pulled the wrong crypto to promote, you could get hit by [an class action lawsuit](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/18/22941470/bitconnect-ponzi-bitcoin-securities-act-sec-lawsuit-influencers-youtube-tiktok) as per US laws, especially if [you been promoting $TON publicly](https://t.me/toncoin/192).
* From [January 2022](https://github.blog/2022-02-04-release-radar-jan-2022/) and [February 2022 Release Radar by GitHub](https://github.blog/2022-03-17-release-radar-feb-2022/): Some open-source software that reached their v1 milestone for January 2022 are [tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec) and [Another Pomodoro](https://github.com/Hanziness/AnotherPomodoro), plus [ToolJet](https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet), [jSON Visivo](https://github.com/AykutSarac/jsonvisio.com), [Xata Screenshot](https://github.com/xataio/screenshot), [Buf CLI](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf) and [Python-TUF](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf) for February 2022. Honorable mentions include [an #StandWithUkraine README banner](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/StandWithUkraine), [GitLens](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens), [nut.js](https://nutjs.dev/), and [HTTPie](https://twitter.com/httpie/status/1485684105085919234). Head over to the linked Release Radar articles mentioned earlier for the full picture.
* Meanwhile in Bullshit HQ, carbon capture tech is still [far off track from reaching its goal](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/18/22940826/carbon-capture-tech-wrong-direction-power-plants-industrial-emissions) of decarbonizing the heavy industry.

## Community stuff

In most cases, community news usually fall here, but sometimes we also bring some picks from the community too. Sometimes, staff do the mess here in case we don't have enough community news yet.

* Sadly, we missed CES 2022 to be covered here, but the crew from @TheVerge [talked about the trends for this edition of CES](https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/31/lets-talk-ces-2022-trends). TL;DR: Dropouts due to pandemic, remote work, and Lidar.
* ICYMI: Hermitcraft Season 9 hype train left the station on March 5, but you can do the recap on [why it's delayed in the first place](https://cluemily.tumblr.com/post/675144810133372928/from-jevins-latest-stream-at-about-21220-he), [the announcement thread (AKA easter egg) on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HermitCraft/comments/t5h5ci/comment/hz5h4xk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) ([start here on Twitter](https://twitter.com/docm77/status/1499051911428911107?s=20&t=27jAV9kKiwtp1g2yKVMdZA) for the original thread then dig deeper on each Hermit's posts from their profiles), [the townhall Q&A transcript](https://www.reddit.com/r/HermitCraft/comments/sweww8/hermitcraft_town_hall_stream_qa_thread/) and [the season information sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/HermitCraft/comments/t78411/hermitcraft_season_9_information_thread/), just in case your mind is still stuck in the void.
* More legalese ahead about what's went gone to public domain status, as per US copyright law: A. A. Milne’s Winnie-the-Pooh, Ernest Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises, and other books, movies, and compositions from 1926 are [entered the public domain status on January 2022](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/1/22862358/winnie-the-pooh-sun-also-rises-enter-public-domain) (heads up, just the original books, not the Disney adaptions in later years). There's even an detailed advice from an experienced copyright lawyer [in case corporate lawyers chose violence and even abuse trademark laws against public domain-based works](https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2022/bcvpd/).

## Staff Picks

This is where we pick the content ourselves from our throves of articles from that dump in Telegram (link is available below).

* Speaking of that busy tax season, Joe Schroeder's research has shown [that accountants’ pay has direct effects on the quality of audits](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11142-018-9458-y). The worst case scenario for accountants with
[poor work-life balance and totally burnt out are worse audits means more restatements](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3095057).
* Considering switching your servers to FreeBSD from Linux? [Learn from an FreeBSD sysadmin](https://it-notes.dragas.net/2022/01/24/why-were-migrating-many-of-our-servers-from-linux-to-freebsd/) on how he manages to do that with some backend pain.
* We don't talk about the pandemic narrative collapse (and [how Trudeu abused the emergency powers against protesters for **terrorist financing**](https://t.me/covidpositivenews/250)) here due to mainstream media calling it as `disinformation` and more gatekeeping $#!tf\*\*kery (even through there are research papers uncovering the truth they may censored), but here's [how Facebook twisted Canada’s trucker convoy into an international movement](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/19/22941291/facebook-canada-trucker-convoy-gofundme-groups-viral-sharing) and it's been a mess here ever since.

## Updates on Community Updates Radio

We have [an hooks server](https://gitlab.com/RecapTime/infra/community-updates-radio-hooks-deta) deployed on [Deta.sh](https://deta.sh) for things like handling sending requests to different APIs, but we're still ironing out on how we pull context and the format yet.

You'll expect to get fresh feeds by later this year as the earliest and/or December if things go into its chaotic state, once we're done with the testing part of the things. Right now, you can follow Community Updates Radio on Discord, Telegram, Guilded and on Matrix to get the feed pretty soon.

## Closing message

Thanks for opening this newsletter issue! You can find us elsewhere at <https://communityradar.bio.link>, including the link to the Revue newsletter if you prefer email and everything in between, plus Community Updates Radio for more frequent feed of tech news ans then some. See you in next issue!

**Not enough content?** We usually stash articles for curation in future issues on [our official Telegram article links dump chat](), just in case you want to see stuff we have in store. Sometimes, they maybe not included here due to time constraints, but Just a quick note, there are some articles that may be not indexed in our dump chat that may added in the future with tag `#LateSubmissions` and replied to an issue's checkpoint or to original entry for additional context.
