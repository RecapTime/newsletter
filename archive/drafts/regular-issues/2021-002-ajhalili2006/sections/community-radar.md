## In the Community Radar

Here's what we found under the radar in the community news. If we missed something there, let us [know in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/MadeByThePinsHub/RecapTime/newsletter-archive/issues) so we can add it on future issues.

* BitwardenRS is now Vaultwarden to prevent confusion and possible trademark issues. [See the discussion board for details](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/discussions/1642).
* GitLab SaaS is now heading towards GitLab 14.0, with some breaking changes such as complete removal of
`WIP` prefix for `Draft` prefix, among other things. (For self-hosted people, read the [CE/EE changelog over here](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/06/22/gitlab-14-0-released/).)
* **From JS Party:** Need to use Node.js in the browser without disabling security features on your Electron apps? No problem, [WebContainners by StackBiliz is here to help](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5U83QXrfKl7lUhEY87PyyL?si=oQ8NlnpTRsSAvraTpzCdng&utm_source=copy-link&dl_branch=1). (It's in beta as of time of writing, so proceed at your own risk and will be open-source once in GA.) It's still Node.js you know and love, but complied as WebAssembly and powered by Chromium's V8 engine (so you don't need to worry about all the chaos management in patching V8 side on the Node.js binary itself if you want).
* But what about an full-blown Ubuntu (or Alpine) desktop in an container inside an browser (without installing any VNC client)? [Watch this video from Techno Tim](https://youtu.be/Gd9bvdkIXOQ) on how to setup an minimal Linux desktop in Docker with Compose.
* Did Valve cancelling native Linux games for Proton on the Steam Deck? [Probably yes.](https://youtu.be/8SFBoB6xijY) And if game devs either stopped maintaining native Linux support  or aren't familiar enough with Linux to start with, then the end users get f**ked. (Ethan Lee may even [retire from programming for this BS](https://nuclearmonster.com/2021/07/ethan-flibitijibibo-lee-may-retire-from-programming-due-to-valves-proton/).)
